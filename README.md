This guide will take you through the following
1. <a href="#What-is-a-category">What is a category</a>
2. <a href="#How-to-access-your-categories">How to access your categories</a>
3. <a href="#How-to-add-a-category">How to add a category</a>

 <a id="What-is-a-category"></a> 
## What is a category
A category is the broadest way to classify all the inventory that you have uploaded to your Slate store. To learn more on how to upload inventory read this [guide](https://www.google.com).
The simplest way to understand how a category can help you filter your inventory is by using the following examples:
|Example|Inventory Upload|Categories|What can be in this category|
|:-----:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------------------------:|
|Resteraunt|Chicken corn soup|Starters|Chicken corn soup|
|          |Chicken tikka pizza|Mains|Chicken tikka pizza|
|          |Ice cream|Desserts|Ice cream|
|          |Fresh apple juice|Drinks|Coca-cola; Fresh apple juice|
|          |Coca-cola|              |                          |
|Fashion|Pakistan cricket cap|Caps|Pakistan cricket cap|
|       |Karachi Kings shirt|Shirts|Karachi Kings shirt; Lahore Qalandars shirt; Peshawar Zalmi shirt|
|       |Lahore Qalanders shirt|Others|Liverpool football club socks|
|       |Peshawar Zalmi shirt|      |      |
|       |Liverpool football club socks|    | 


  if you are a resteraunt owner(or a home-based food business), it is very likely that you can split whatever you are selling into categories that your customers are normally used to seeing. For example, any customer ordering food from a business will be used to the categories of a **starter, main, dessert and drinks**. Similarly if you are selling clothes, your customer will be familiar with concepts like **evening wear, formal wear, casual wear**.
You will be in the best position to determine what are appropriate categories for your store. A merchant selling local Pakistani clothing will have different categories (such as **readymade shalwar, readymade kurta or cloth for shalwar or cloth for kurta**) compared to a merchant selling Western clothing (such as **denim jeans** or **cotton trousers** or **collared full-sleeve shirt** or **collared half-sleeve shirt**).


<a id="How-to-access-your-categories"></a> 
## How to access your categories
- You can access your categories by choosing [**Categories**](https://www.google.com) from your Slate dashboard as shown in the image below. When you first access your categories this will be empty.

 <a id="How-to-create-an-order"></a> 
 ## How to create an order
 
 Steps to create an order are:
 
 <a id="branch"></a> 
  - Choose the location you are generating the order from. For example if your store has 2 locations (such as Islamabad and Karachi) you will choose the location from which you will be fulfilling the order placed by your customer. If your customer is based in Karachi you would normally chose your store location as Karachi but there can be exceptions for example if the item you want to sell is available in your Islamabad store. If you only have one store (you are a home based business you will have one location).

  <a id="What-is-inventory"></a>
  ## What is inventory
  
  Each product or service (depending on the type of business) you list on your Slate store is part of your inventory. Your inventory keeps track of the number of units you have in stock. Each business has different products or services listed on their Slate stores. The simplest way to understand the different types of products or services different businesses can have is by using the following example: 
  
 <p align="center">
  
 |Type of store|Inventory product/service|
|:-----:|:--------------:|
|Resteraunt|Pepperoni Pizza|
|          |Margherita Pizza|
|Pharmacy|Paracetamol|
|       |Deep heat spray|
|       |Bandages|
|       |Gauze|
|Car wash|Standard wash|
|        |Wash + Buff|
  
  </p>
  
  if you're a resteraunt owner (or a home-based business) you will list the items on your menu on your Slate store such as a pizzeria will list different types of pizzas they have available on their menu. For a car wash owner (or a door to door car washing service) you will list the different type of services you offer. 

 <a id="how-to-access-inventory"></a>
 ## How to access inventory
 You can access your inventory by choosing **Inventory** from your Slate dashboard as shown below:
 
  <a id="how-to-add-an-item"></a>
  ## How to add an item
  
  Steps to add an item:
  
   - To add an item choose **Add Item**. This will open a side bar as shown in the image below. This is the start of how you add an item to your Slate store.
 
 <p align="center">  <img width="650" height="400" alt="[Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 3 59 27 PM]" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101874906/160824797-b3c6bc5b-b8c7-4c4c-9705-c1b2f02c06dc.png"> </p>
 
   - Name your item and add a description to continue. For our example we have added a pepperoni pizza for a pizzeria. 
   - You will now need to edit your item which includes the following: 
 
  - Choose a category the item falls under. This classifies the item you have uploaded. To learn more about how to create a category <a href="#How-to-add-a-category">click here</a>
  - Choosing an image to display for your item. This will be an image that you have uploaded to your **Media** section. To learn more about how to add media to your Slate store you can read this [guide](https://www.google.com).
  - Create variation(s) for your item. The item is the shell and the content within it is variation. for example we are creating a pepperoni pizza for a pizza the variations for are; 8 inches, 12 inches and 16 inches, the sizes the resteraunt offers. Likewise, if you are a clothing store your variations for a crew neck T-shirt would be small, medium and large.
 
 <a id="Add-variation"></a>
  ## How to add a variation
 
 - To create a variation choose **Add Variation**. 
 - Name the variation, add a SKU number, the price of the item and click the track inventory slider if you wish to keep track of your inventory. If yes, then choose the location the item is available at. 
 - Each item has to have a number of units available, for example if you're a clothing business and the number of white crew neck t-shirts in size medium is 45 then you will add 45 in stock. This is done by choosing **Select** under the **Actions** column in the variations table, choose **Update Stock**, choose **Increase** to add to the number of units available for your listed variant and the number that you have in stock.

- Simple content model and structure. Easy to adjust to your needs.
- Use the [synchronization feature](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/synchronization) of our [Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/).
- Responsive/adaptive images via [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-image/) and our [Images API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/synchronization/initial-synchronization-of-entries-of-a-specific-content-type).


<a id="getting-started"></a>
## Getting started

See our [official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).

### Get the source code and install dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog.git
$ npm install
```

Or use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli).

```
$ gatsby new contentful-starter-blog https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog/
```

### Set up of the needed content model and create a configuration file

This project comes with a Contentful setup command `npm run setup`.

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API and then import the needed content model into the space you define and write a config file (`./.contentful.json`).

`npm run setup` automates that for you but if you want to do it yourself rename `.contentful.json.sample` to `.contentful.json` and add your configuration in this file.

## Crucial Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

### `npm run serve`

Spin up a production-ready server with your blog. Don't forget to build your page beforehand.

## Deployment

See the [official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).
