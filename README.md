In the instance you forget the password for your Slate store choose **Forgot Password**. Taking you to the forgot password field as shown in the image below. 

<p align="center"><img width="650" height="400" alt="[Forgotten Password (1)]" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101874906/159889449-4dca2e47-96a7-46c5-80d1-8813c07de61e.png"> </p>

leading you to the final stage of your password recovery process as seen in the image below. the first field requires you to enter the email address you have registered your slate account with,  confirm the email address in the next field provided. 
The next field requires you to fill the confirmation code you have recieved via email, this shall be a 6 digit code.

# What is a category
A category is the broadest way to classify all the inventory that you have uploaded to your Slate store. To learn more on how to upload inventory read this [guide](https://www.google.com).
The simplest way to understand how a category can help you filter your inventory is by using the following examples:
|Example|Inventory Upload|Categories|What can be in this category|
|:-----:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------------------------:|
|Resteraunt|Chicken corn soup|Starters|Chicken corn soup|
|          |Chicken tikka pizza|Mains|Chicken tikka pizza|
|          |Ice cream|Desserts|Ice cream|
|          |Fresh apple juice|Drinks|Coca-cola; Fresh apple juice|
|          |Coca-cola|              |                          |
|Fashion|Pakistan cricket cap|Caps|Pakistan cricket cap|
|       |Karachi Kings shirt|Shirts|Karachi Kings shirt; Lahore Qalandars shirt; Peshawar Zalmi shirt|
|       |Lahore Qalanders shirt|Others|Liverpool football club socks|
|       |Peshawar Zalmi shirt|      |      |
|       |Liverpool football club socks|    | 


  if you are a resteraunt owner(or a home-based food business), it is very likely that you can split whatever you are selling into categories that your customers are normally used to seeing. For example, any customer ordering food from a business will be used to the categories of a **starter, main, dessert and drinks**. Similarly if you are selling clothes, your customer will be familiar with concepts like **evening wear, formal wear, casual wear**.
You will be in the best position to determine what are appropriate categories for your store. A merchant selling local Pakistani clothing will have different categories (such as **readymade shalwar, readymade kurta or cloth for shalwar or cloth for kurta**) compared to a merchant selling Western clothing (such as **denim jeans** or **cotton trousers** or **collared full-sleeve shirt** or **collared half-sleeve shirt**).


<a id="How-to-access-your-categories"></a> 
## How to access your categories
- You can access your categories by choosing [**Categories**](https://www.google.com) from your Slate dashboard as shown in the image below. When you first access your categories this will be empty.
<p align="center"> <width="650" heigh="400" alt="Screenshot 2022-03-22 at 2 04 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101874906/159445112-b35d2abe-3c41-4a85-aaa7-c58333a58fd7.png"> </p>
  
- When you first access your categories this will be empty. Eventually you would expect this categories section to look like the below depending on your business and what you are selling.

<a id="getting-started"></a>
## Getting started

See our [official Contentful getting started guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/get-started/).

### Get the source code and install dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog.git
$ npm install
```

Or use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli).

```
$ gatsby new contentful-starter-blog https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog/
```

### Set up of the needed content model and create a configuration file

This project comes with a Contentful setup command `npm run setup`.

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API and then import the needed content model into the space you define and write a config file (`./.contentful.json`).

`npm run setup` automates that for you but if you want to do it yourself rename `.contentful.json.sample` to `.contentful.json` and add your configuration in this file.

## Crucial Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

### `npm run serve`

Spin up a production-ready server with your blog. Don't forget to build your page beforehand.

## Deployment
